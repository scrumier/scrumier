# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I'm **Sonam** (aka @scrumier), a passionate software developer and student at **42 Lyon**. Iâ€™m deeply interested in low-level programming, especially with **C** and **C++**, and love working on high-performance, system-level applications. 

## ðŸ›  Skills & Notable Projects
- **Languages**: C/C++ â€” I focus on performance and system-level programming to push the boundaries of efficiency.
- **Tools**: **Neovim**, **Git**, and **MacOS/Linux** are my go-tos for a smooth development experience.
- **Projects**:
  - [**Cub3D**](https://github.com/scrumier/cub3d): A fun 3D graphics project inspired by classic games.
  - [**Minishell**](https://github.com/scrumier/minishell): A custom Unix shell with core shell functionalities.
  - [**ft_IRC**](https://github.com/scrumier/ft_irc): An IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server developed in C++.
  - [**Philosophers**](https://github.com/scrumier/philosophers): A concurrency challenge simulating the dining philosophers problem.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
At the moment, Iâ€™m diving into **three.js** for my final project at 42, called **ft_transcendence**. Itâ€™s an exciting blend of 3D graphics and modern web tech thatâ€™s pushing me to learn and experiment.
